# Simple English


 - Have a look at this comic: [Computer problems https://xkcd.com/722/](https://xkcd.com/722/)
 - And the this one: [Up Goer Five https://xkcd.com/1133/](https://xkcd.com/1133/)
 
Both of those comics are explaining technical things using the ~1,000~ ten hundred most common words in english.

Also if you have time, watch these two music videos
 - ["Space Oddity‚Äù By David Bowie (orignal)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D67kmFzSh_o) <-- Only need to watch first twenty seconds; unless you are a big David Bowie liking-person.
 - ["Weird space thing" (Simple English) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrdAvmr-MA)
 
 
We are going to make our own version of this tool: [simplewriter](http://xkcd.com/simplewriter/)
with a few improvments.

The first version of this is going to be a little rubbish, & may be better if you just built in javascript. However we are going to improve on it ant the point is to learn about database access in .net not js.
